Description: TNW Social Count is a WordPress plugin that solves the problem of social sharing the proper way. No more third-party scripts that slow down your site and ugly buttons that clutter your design.
The plugin has two parts: The backend part saves the number of Twitter retweets, Facebook likes, Google Plus and LinkedIn shares as post_meta information. 
The frontend part renders a share button on the same fashion as on The Next Web blog.
